## Hackathon Participation

SolanaFlow was built as part of the **Southampton Decentralised Society Web3 Hack** with support from **Superteam UK**. We aim to leverage Solana's high-speed, low-cost transactions and compressed NFTs to make productivity rewards seamless and scalable.

## Judging Criteria & Goals

To align with the hackathon judging criteria, SolanaFlow focuses on:

1. **Impact** → Helping users stay productive with blockchain incentives.
2. **Solution** → Minimal, efficient code to achieve functionality.
3. **Completeness** → A near-production-ready app with real Solana integration.
4. **Blockchain Utilization** → Using **compressed NFTs** and **fast Solana transactions** to power the reward system.
